Hobbies/Interests: Video Games, Movies, Books, Sports, Mechanics, I enjoy country Western Dancing, I hope to study in Website development and data security
Programming Background: I started programming last year as a freshman, it has always interested me but
we didn't have a good computer program at my high school. I have grown to love programming
and I am super interested in website development because it has so many options and it seems like
a lot of fun.
I am very excited to take this class and I think that it will be very interesting to do so.
